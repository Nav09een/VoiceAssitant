# VoiceAssitant
The Voice Assistant project is an innovative software application designed to interact with users through spoken language. Using natural language processing and speech recognition technologies, the Voice Assistant aims to understand user commands and provide relevant information . The primary goal of a Voice Assistant is to assist users in various aspects of their daily lives. It can answer questions, provide recommendations, offer weather updates, set reminders, manage calendars, control smart home devices, play music, and much more. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence, Voice Assistants continuously learn and improve their understanding and responses to user queries. This is a one of the module of the project developed for customer care in Smart India Hackathon 2022.
